Like any researcher, I love procrastinating.  Here are my favorite ways to do that.

    More to come...

At UCI, I am studying the response of tropical forests (the Amazon and Indonesian archipelago) to different types of land surface and environmental change. Human activities like deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions alter energy and moisture fluxes at the land surface, which in turn can impact regional atmospheric dynamics, and Iâ€™m using WRF and CESM to better understand these interactions. More broadly, my current and previous research has been motivated by the goal of understanding and improving Earth system models so that they can be used to make better predictions of regional climate change and its societal impacts.
