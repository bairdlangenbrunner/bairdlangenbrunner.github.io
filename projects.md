# Python for climate scientists

I've helped organize a few different Python tutorials aimed at grad students and researchers interested in learning the language.  Most of these center around NetCDF analysis and plotting maps.  Currently, I'm helping with a four-week tutorial at UCI; check out the GitHub repository [here][github-ess-python] for more info.

# Research

    More to come...

At UCI, I am studying the response of tropical forests (the Amazon and Indonesian archipelago) to different types of land surface and environmental change. Human activities like deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions alter energy and moisture fluxes at the land surface, which in turn can impact regional atmospheric dynamics, and Iâ€™m using WRF and CESM to better understand these interactions. More broadly, my current and previous research has been motivated by the goal of understanding and improving Earth system models so that they can be used to make better predictions of regional climate change and its societal impacts.
