<div class="flex-right prose">

I work as a research analyst at [Global Energy Monitor](https://globalenergymonitor.org/), where I help manage the [Global Fossil Infrastructure Tracker (GFIT)](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-fossil-infrastructure-tracker/). Before August 2021, I previously worked as an editor at [Nature Climate Change](https://www.nature.com/nclimate/), where I handled research and commentary submissions on the physical climate system.

I received my PhD in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://www.atmos.ucla.edu/) from UCLA (2015), where I worked in the [Climate Systems Interactions group](http://research.atmos.ucla.edu/csi/). I also have a Sc.B. in Geophysics from Brown University (2009).

My PhD research was driven by the goal of understanding and improving Earth system models, so that they can be used to make better predictions of climate change and its impacts.

After grad school, I worked as a postdoc in the UC Irvine [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.ess.uci.edu/), where I studied landâ€“atmosphere interaction in the [Pritchard](http://sites.uci.edu/pritchard/) and [Randerson](http://sites.uci.edu/randersonlab/) research groups. This work was motivated by understanding how tropical forests respond to different types of land surface and environmental change, including increased carbon dioxide concentrations and deforestation, and how these changes affect the overlying atmosphere.
